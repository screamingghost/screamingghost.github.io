# screamingghost.github.io
An archive of Screaming Goat, may they RIP.

# State

It's just a flat rip of whatever was available on Wayback Machine, into a flat static site. There's no real support for writefreely features. Some subsites might be missing if they weren't indexed by Wayback Machine. 

# TODO

1. Make site index into a hierarchy, so it's easier to organize
2. Create templates to create new pages easily from markdown
3. Add some Bees content, probably about PRC OSINT research
